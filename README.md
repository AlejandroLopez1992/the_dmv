#Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
What was hard about working with code you did not write?
What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

#1. The steps I took to dig into this code were to start with each class and open up it's spec file simultaneously from the simplest class to the most complicated. I read the tests to understand the intended purpose of each class and method's purpose. Afterwards I thought about how the classes interact together and which methods can be called in other classes.
#2. A difficulty for me in reading the tests when running rspec is that because they use the describe function for each individual test, I made mistakes in figuring out which test was failing. I had to read through the errors much more thoroughly and repeatedly in order to fully grasp them compared to when reading my tests. 
#3. I would describe the difficulty to be moderate. I understood what the tests were meant to test and what the methods were meant to do, but my lack of expericnce in reading other's code led me to making multiple errors when it comes to resolving the bugs and consuming way more time than if I was already familiar with a ton of other peoples code.
